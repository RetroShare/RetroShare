These instructions assume that you already have a development environment setup 
on macOS 10.12 with command line compilation tools, git and brew installed.

- get RS sources from github repository
    git clone https://github.com/RetroShare/RetroShare.git
- install Qt5.7 using the provided installer from https://www.qt.io/qt5-7/
- install with brew RS dependences
    brew install sqlcipher
    brew install miniupnpc
    brew install libmicrohttpd
    brew install speex
    brew install speexdsp
    brew install homebrew/science/opencv
    brew install libxml2
You can list with 'brew ls <package name>' the installed files locations
- modify macx section of retroshare.pri file in order to specify the include and
library paths for the above installed dependences, e.g.
    INC_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2k/include
	LIB_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2k/lib
	INC_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/sqlcipher/3.4.0/include
	LIB_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/sqlcipher/3.4.0/lib
	INC_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/miniupnpc/2.0/include
	LIB_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/miniupnpc/2.0/lib
	INC_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/libmicrohttpd/0.9.52/include
	LIB_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/libmicrohttpd/0.9.52/lib
	INC_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/speex/1.2.0/include
	LIB_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/speex/1.2.0/lib
	INC_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/speexdsp/1.2rc3/include
	LIB_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/speexdsp/1.2rc3/lib
	INC_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/opencv/2.4.13.2/include
	LIB_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/opencv/2.4.13.2/lib
	INC_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.9.4_2/include
	LIB_DIR += /usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.9.4_2/lib
- generate the Makefiles with qmake (assuming that
you are already in the sources root folder)
	~/Qt/5.7/clang_64/bin/qmake
- compile RS with
	make
- at the end of the compilation process, you can start RS GUI with
	open retroshare-gui/src/RetroShare06.app
- in order to generate RS installer use
	~/Qt/5.7/clang_64/bin/macdeployqt retroshare-gui/src/RetroShare06.app -dmg
The installer can be found in 'retroshare-gui/src/RetroShare06.dmg'.
