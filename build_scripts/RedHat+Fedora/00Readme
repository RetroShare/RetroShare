This is the build directory for RPM based Linux distributions like RedHat
Enterprise Linux and compatible distributions (CentOS, Oracle Linux, ...) or
Fedora.

To create an RPM package (as well as Source RPM) for your distribution, just
run the makePackages.sh script found in this directory, like so:

	./makepackages.sh

The script needs the rpmbuild command, which is part of the rpm-build package.

In case any build dependency is missing, the rpmbuild command will fail. Just
install the missing package(s) and restart the script (Hint: all needed
packages are listed in the provided retroshare06.spec file.)
