Pull files from Android device to prepare a debugging sysroot
Inspired by:
https://fw4spl-org.github.io/fw4spl-blog/2015/07/27/Native-debugging-on-Android-with-QtCreator.html

The goal is to have a local copy of the sysroot of the connected device.
For that we use the command `adb pull <remote_dir_or_file> <local_dir_or_file>`

We will get a copy of:

- `/system/lib/`
- `/vendor/lib/`
- `libc.so`
- `libcutils.so`

As well as the binaries `linker` and `app_process`

IMPORTANT:
from one device to another, the remote file `app_process` can be a binary file
or a symlink to a binary file - which is NOT ok for us.
That's so we will try to pull every known possible variants of `app_process`,
e.g. `app_process32` or `app_process_init`
