         * added generic function to return the correct string for scanf for unsigned ints depending on the 
            size of the actual variable that is scanned. Should fix the rehash bug and bugs corrupting 
            timestamps on some 32bits systems

         * patch "AddSearchFilesourceSorted_6951.diff" from Phenom. Adds correct sorting for search results.
         * extended max chunk TTL to 1 hour. A short TTL is not anymore needed since chuns are shared between sources

      - Chat
         * patch "chatdialog_allow_buttons_from_different_plugins_3" from electron. ChatDialog allows 
           now Buttons from different Plugins.
         * patch "Fix_ChatLobbyAutoSubscribe_6951.diff" from Phenom. Fixes request for existing lobbies 
            when no lobby ihas been found yet. Code beautification
         * added lobby ID as tooltip to lobby list

      - Forums
         * added ElidedLabel to be used in places where labels might be too long and therefore 
           trigger an unwanted window resize. This is currently used as forum thread titles (Patch from Phenom)

      - Channels
         * patch "Fix_ChannelNotificationFeedLink" from Phenom. Allows to finish loading a channel 
           before jumping to the linked post
         * Added a default background color for the Channel Message Logo for a better look and feel, 
            removed stretching of the logo, set a minimum size, background is now filled black.

      - Notification
         * reworked the notification system, which is now a standalone service. Now plugins can receive notifications.

         * Limit number of feed items to 500 to avoid flooding
         * Changed the default stylesheet color for the Security Feed
         * improved display/fixed bugs in security item

      - plugins

         * Enabled sorting for the QTreeWidget's
         * fixed temporary to load the Wiki Groups Tree at startup, auto update seems not to work.

      - core
         * moved PGP id and SSLid types into rsid.h, and renamed them with a more appropriate name
         * fixed cipher list for openssl. ECDHE is not configured, so it cannot be used
         * added serialisation methods for SSLId and time_t
         * added an option in the pro file for dsdv, as it is compiled when not used
         * removed status member from FileDetails. Not used => misleading
         * removed asserts in reader_armoured.c, reader_encrypted_se.c, reader_encrypted_seip.c, readerwriter.c
         * Allow loading packets of large size from config files (fixed storing of big messages), 
           and continue on config files skipping items that cannot be deserialised (Modified patch from Phenom)
         * put a hard limit to packet size in pqistore to avoid calling realloc with fancy numbers 
           when the stream has been corrupted

      - fixed bug due to ot sending notifications to the file lists
      - added missign cleanup call in RsAES.cc, causing a small memory leak

      - fixed small error in pgphandler, potentially adding empty certs in database
      - limited the number of packets to be parsed in a row, to prevent compressed 
        data to contain an enormous number of packets. Fixes one possible attack pointed out by HM
      - removed potential uninitialized memory read in TlvKey item.
      - fixed mismatched free/delete in p3channels.cc
      - fixed bug introduced in 6965 that prevented people joining private lobbies to see the messages and talk

retroshare (0.5.5-0.6933~precise) precise; urgency=low

   * Improvements

      - fixed up some debug text (patch from H.Morgan)
      - reduced string for lol bomb filtering, to filter out <\?xml* instead of <\?xml\ *
      - Added freeze option in NetworkView (Modified patch from K. Eisentraut)
      - Updated languages from Transifex
      - fixed up compatibility with Qt5

     PGP
      - added restriction to only accept self-signed certificates for friend keys
      - added test program for identity import
      - removed asserts from validate.c, and signature.c in openpgp-sdk
        it will not be shared until re-hashed. Should prevent chunks error in files that get hashed while being copied.
      - do not accept keys without a uid. Previously this was crashing RS
      - added check over recursive compression depth. Fixes CVE-2013-4402

     Channels:
      - Added back the Subscribe Button to Channels
      - Use destination directory when manually downloading a file from a channel
      - Show destination directory in channel details
      - Fixed utf8 issue when choosing the destination directory

     GUI
      - show fingerprint in ConfCertDialog, and splitted the string with spaces. Removed 
        the use of the ambiguous peer id for both pgp and locations ids

     Global router (Not active yet. Is a replacement to tunnels for messaging. Wil allow offline anonymous distant messages)
      - squeleton code for the whole system
      - computation/update of routing probabilities

     File Transfer (Speed changes according to experiments from jolavilette. Brings the max LAN speed from 1.3MB/s to approx 13MB/s)
      - set desiredRate of peers to 10MB/s instead of 1MB/s
      - maximum number of active chunks per peer is now 20 (that was a serious limiting factor)
      - ticks that bring no data are not accounted for in the speed estimate anymore. The data is averaged over all ticks 
        since the previous non zero data chunk -> this brings much more stability to sources and removes lots of oscillation.
      - added post-hash check for file modification. If the file has been modified while being hashed, 
      - removed false warning that come up when openning a non existing file in ftFileCreator.

     Shared Files
      - changed re-hashign strategy. Now uses in priority the system time of the index file as a reference for new files. This automatically
        accounts for changes in system time and fixes the re-hashing bug for daylight changing time. In case the reference time cannot be
        establishd, the comparison reverts to the old method. This change is backward compatible and should not cause a re-hash.

   * Bug fixing
      - fixed import of retroshare identities that have multiple signatures from the same key ID. Fixed bug reported by claude37
      - split lastRecvTimeStamp into two different time stamps: one for last
        time the file is wrote (or data is received) and one for last activity
        that is used (and sometimes reset) by ftcontroller when queuing files
      - fixed display of correct IP for connected friends. Only the external IP was shown previously. Port is not 
        shown because it is random and could be misleading. 
      - filter out disallowed direct sources from file request source list. Should systematically prevent unwanted direct transfers

retroshare (0.5.5-0.6804~precise) precise; urgency=low

  * Improvements
     Optimisations/compilation:
      - re-wrote cleanupDirectory() function. As this a cause of the slow startup.  Startup time is massively improved!
      - Fixed compile of the libraries with MinGW 4.8 on Windows.
      - Removed the external library pthreads 2.8.0 on Windows build and used the library of MinGW (version 2.8.0 too). 
        This fixes header mixup of bo th versions.
      - Switched to the release version of pthread so the name of the dll changes from pthreadGC2d.dll to pthreadGC2.dll. 
        The new dll can be found in the bin directory of MinGW.
      - Optimized p3HistoryMgr::cleanOldMessages

     File Transfer:
      - restore file state when restart (Modified patch from Phenom)
      - Enabled multi-tunneling by consistently perturbating partial tunnel id in TRs.
        This causes tunnels with a different route to have different ids and therefore
        coexist as different sources for a given transfer.
        This should cause file transfers to have more tunnels and therefore a better balance
        of bandwidth over intermediate peers. This needs to be evaluated on a large scale network.
      - included random bias in tunnel ID computation to make them impossible to correlate to the end points

     Distant chat/lobbies/chat:
      - added the possibility to distant chat with unverified identities, while warning the user about it. Should help distant chatting.
      - removed warning that happens when lobby has no activity

     Key creation
      - added entropy collection system based on mouse movement to location/identity creation, to make keys less predictable

     Connectivity:
      - Made connection progress dialog only show up when really making friend

     Security:
      - Enabled PFS for SSH connections, based on a 4096 bits safe prime. This is retro-compatible, meaning that 
        old peers will connect to the new one using PFS if they act as a client (meaning they request the connection)
      - added limit to posts on chat lobbies to 6000 characters, removing the risk of enormous posts crafted to kill the msg history
      - added filter to take care of svg bombs that can be hidden in the strings in lobbies,forums,channels and chat
      - added control for suspicious message activity in chat lobbies. Lobby items are not bounced if coming 
        from a peer that sends more messages per seconds than a given limit. The limit is adaptive and depends on lobby count
      - added limit in number of chat lobby ids sent by a peer
      - added filter to remove xml bombs in all std::wstrings. 

     Various gui stuff:
      - added a "Load Images" system to messages.
      - added new delegate for BW statistics window. Changed column names to more appropriate values (Patch from Phenom)
      - Added proper sorting of DL files according to sources (Patch from Phenom)
      - changed the connect wizard so that we can add someone key to keyring without making friend. 
      - fixed image resizing for channel thumbnails. Apparently there is a bug in Qt preventing 
        Qt::KeepAspectRatioByExpanding to work correctly
      - Changed the additional buttons of ChatLobbyDialog and AudioPopupChatDialog to QToolButton.
      - added some sound files
      - changed the voip icons and the tooltips
      - added fingerprint to cryptopage
      - added tree items for chat lobbies. 
      - moved help browser from MainPage to new base class FloatingHelpBrowser
      - added warning info label to MakeFriendWizard
      - Added info widget for encrypted messages in MessageWidget
      - removed copy/paste of links of type PERSON in friendlist. This caused confusion and did not provide 
        anything useful since the creation of the full certificate links
      - changed default header text and context menu icons
      - changed the default style layout of profile creation dialog
      - highlight peers in network graph according to friendship distance from selected node

     Chat lobbies
      - added history parameters for chat lobbies
      - added max storage time for items in chat history. Avoids filling up the history with chat from volatile peers.
      - worked out the layout in config->ChatPage in a more compact design and added help

  * Bug fixes
      - fixed missing update of transferred bytes count, that caused tunnels to not show a correct speed estimate on server side
      - fixed bug in turtle router, causing potential memory access error in rare occasions (sendItem does not 
        delete items fast enough, normally).
      - added missing setPeerState that caused tunnels to get stuck to default minimum rate unless 
        the list of connected peers change
      - fixed bug showing play for unfinished files and preview for finished ones

        such as properly setting peers names everywhere, but the service works. Have fun using it!
      - updated values for min/normal partial packet size to 1MB in openpgp-sdk, so that we do not create partial packets 
        for everyday use. We will have to properly extend openpgp-sdk to support parsing of partial packets if we want to 
        PGP-encrypt chunks larger than 1MB
      - patched RsCollection code to disallow crafted xml bombs
      - plugged send message from security item to send distant messages

        PFS (which it should use)
      - fixed void * pointer maths.


  * Bug fixes
  		- Added missing location from cert when addign new friend
      - Added missing IndicateConfigChanged to p3PeerMgrIMPL::setDynDNS
      - Fixed crash when closing the main window without the setting "Minimize to Tray Icon"
      - Renamed the setting "Do not Minimize to Tray Icon" to "Minimize to Tray
        Icon" and fixed wrong usage Please check your setting!
      - removed dropping an entire config file when a single item cannot be serialized.
      - removed time shift warning in lobbies. Changed into warning in help panel
      - fixed bug allowing malicious peer to display lobby messages in broadcast window
      - patch to avoid corrupting file cache on 64bits archs that store time_t as 32bits (from Stefan Sperling)
      - allow big messages to bounce correctly in lobbies, after fixing a splitting error.
      - fixed lobby aut-subscribe by looking at lobbies every 121 seconds
      - fixed looping in pqistore when a crazily long packet is found. That is
        the result of an unknown bug, but at least we should handle it correctly.

      * Added error handling to xml functions
      * Added xslt transformation
      * Added retransform of existing messages

      * removed #ifdef USE_NEW_CHUNK_CHECKING_CODE (enabled by default). Disable assume_availablility to put chunks or

      * fixed tests: compilation, running, added new util functions, etc. Updated test results.
      * Added little upnp utility / test.
      * added checksum for new certificate format. Will be enabled in 0.6.
      * Fixed up bootstrap singleshot search function. Now returns parameters. Not functioning 100% correctly yet - due

    - retroshare-nogui
      * made port non-optional for -S <port>

retroshare (0.5.4-0.5995~precise) precise; urgency=low

  * Improvements
      - DHT
         * disable bitdht printStatus
         * increased expected dht startup period, as message rate has been dropped.
         * updated bdboot.txt file.

      - Chat
         * Made the private lobbies more accessible:
            - record which friend participates in a lobby even after they unsubscribed. The lobby 
              list that is sent to these 
            - friends contains the privaye lobby as well. In practice, people jsut need to be invited 
              once to a private lobby. 
            - Afterwards, they get the lobby in the list of nearby lobbies and can join by clicking on it.
            - added new item RsChatLobbyList_deprecated2, to replace old existing item. Should be removed in v0.6
            - changed PublicLobbies for VisibleLobbies in the code, to avoid confusion
            - the change is backward compatible, although old peers won't receive private lobby info from 
              new peers, of course.

      - GUI
         * Set email address in GenCertDialog to optional.
         * Fixed display of "TextLabel" in SecurityItem.    - 
         * Added patch from Henry: enable italian language
         * Added patch from Henry: Renamed gpg to pgp
         * removed some unused images
         * Added "Edit Share Permissions" Context Menu entry to My Directions, to edit easily share 
           permissions for each directory
         * Updated languages from transiflex.
         * updated English, Danish, German, Swedish translations
         * Added OperatingMode ComboBox to the status bar
            - Added second (temporary) switch to turtle.
            - Use session switch for OperatingMode.
            - made OperatingMode temporary - not saved.
            - Moved DataRate interface from rsiface (old) -> rsConfig.
            - Internally moved storage of data rate from pqipersongroup -> p3serverconfig
            - made DataRate + Operating Mode work together.
            - add ToolTip to OpModeStatus .... (can't actually view - please correct as necessary)

         * Fixed utf8 characters for group names in RemoteDirModel (shared files).
         * Fixed layout of the FriendRequestPage in ConnectFriendWizard.
         * Added flags for services and service permissions for peers
           Flags are identity-related, meaning that all locations of the same peers have the same flags.
            - It's now possible to tweak which services each peer can use. Service that can be disabled are
              forums/channels, discovery, anonymous routing.
            - by default, peers have all flags on.
      - File Transfer
         * use a std::map to search file hashes instead of sweeping the entire database. Improves performance a lot.

      - OpenPGP-SDK
         * Added function "ops_open" to openpgpsdk to open files with utf8 characters on Windows.
         * changed fopen into RsDirUtil::rs_fopen in PGPHandler, to allow paths with utf8 chars on windows. 
           Shoudl probably fix many startup issues

  * Bugs
      - added proper filtering of directories from RSLinks and RsCollection to avoid the possibility of writing out of the 
        download directory.
      - Added missing closeConnection when the connection dies with SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL.
      - Fixed display of files in flat view. The files of friends are shown again
      - fixed bug in ShareManager causing directory flags to be set on wrong directory after sorting
      - Protected waitingIds with Mutex in pqipersongrp.cc.
      - Reviewed Mutex in pqihandler.
         * In general it is okay, except for: DataRate Handling, and Win32 specific: WaitingList.
         * Cleaned up some functions.
         * renamed createPerson and createListener to locked_createPerson and locked_createListener.
        This is required as neither Listener nor Person are thread safe (TODO).
      - fixed missing error msg in p3cfgmgr when serialisation fails.
      - fixed bug in RemoteDirModel causing infinite loop to happen when group name is unknown

  * Improvements
     - GUI
        * patch from AC to perform html optimization of forum posts using the canonical function optimizeHtml()
        * fixed bug preventing share manager to modify more than one directory at once
        * Moved most of the hardcoded colors of lists and trees to the file qss.default (with help from braindead).
          Now the stylesheet can redefine these colors.
        * Added multiselective mute/unmute to chat lobby. Added mute/unmute with double click on icon.
        * Added flag for hungarian language.
        * Fixed sorting of date in forums
        * redesigned the Chatlobby participants list
            - used now QTreeWidget instead of a QListWidget
            - added icons for display the muted participants
            - added context menu for "Mute participant" ( context menu fix from thunder)

        * Removed context help button from the dialogs (currently not used) and added 
          minimize/maximize buttons to the "floating" dialogs.
        * Added to identify for Channel Files if its a media file(s) or not, to change the Play Button text from "Play" to "Open"

     - FT
        * added dynamic adding of direct sources from file lists. Useful for channels. Is called once every 61 seconds.
        * Added new link type: EXTRA_FILE, to allow sendign links with sources included so as to trigger direct transfer.
          This makes possible to send files through chat without permitting tunnel access to the files. The client requests
          the file as a direct transfer only, using the supplied source.

     - Patch to allow compilation on BSD
     - Fixed command to grab upnp patched version

     - Merged branch that provide group-based file permissions.
          Now users can sort peers into groups in the friend list, and attribute flags and parent groups 
          to the directories in the share manager.
          
        Flags are B-B-N, meaning in order:
           - browsable for peers in the parent groups
           - browsable for everyone
           - network wide for everyone
           Backward compatibility makes previously BN flags been interpreted as -BN, meaning 
           browsable/network wide for everyone.

        The merge also includes a significant improvement of the naming of flags with incompatible types
        which should sort out some existing bugs as well, since inconsistencies in flag usage have been
        found during the process.

  * Bugs
     - added additional checking of incoming compressed chunk map, in case the data is 
       currupted, which might happens with a corrupted ft_transfer.cfg file.
     - fixed permission of drap+dropped files. all attached files get added to extra list, 
       but with different permission flags depending on the client. From that, we compute 
       sharing permissions : turtle, or direct transfer only 
     - suppressed unitialized memory read in p3peers.cc
     - added missing mutex in destructor of ftFileProvider. Probably responsible for some random crashes

        * add timeline storage as well.
        * disabled by default, enable USE_HISTORY in bdnode.c

         There appears to be a bug related to copying bdId's around.
         Some of the bootstrap ids are malformed, and this crashes rs.

  * Bugs
      * Fixed stupid bug inDHT. Labels are the wrong way around.

        * desactivated tunnel shortenning since it cannot produce consistent tunnels every time
        * increase cache TTL for search requests to 240 secs and tunnel requests to 120 secs.

     - Moved some internal stylesheets to the file Standard.qss.
     - Tweaked standard style of the feed items.
     - moved file rsversion.h to rsguiversion.h, since it caused a conflict with libretroshare/src/util/rsversion.h

retroshare (0.5.3-0.5503~natty) natty; urgency=low

  * Improvements
     - Big cleaning of style sheets
        * Moved some internal stylesheets to the file Standard.qss.
        * Set the built-in stylesheet "Standard" as default for new profiles.
        * Removed some unnecessary style sheets.
        * Added two internal stylesheets:
           - qss.default - This file is used as default for all stylesheets (e.g. the frames of 
             the AvatarWidget) and can be overloaded from the selected stylesheet
           - Standard.qss - The standard stylesheet for the current look of RetroShare. More internal stylesheets can be added.
             The plan is to move nearly all internal stylesheets to the files Standard.qss/qss.default. After that the "empty" stylesheet 
             should represent the system theme of the os.

     - Added clear chat history to the context menu of the message text browser
     - Added new base class HeaderFrame - image and text at top of the windows

        * checkbox for using old cert format in security page. Old format used by default, to avoid confusing newbees
        * added new RsCertificate class to handle all certificate actions
     - Several small tweaks to the gui
     - Redesigned the Create Chat lobby dialog
     - Fixed compilation with newer versions of libupnp, except for debian sid which uses a patched old version (crap!)
     - update Spanish translation (from Senpai)
     - Added a new page for user request to ConnectFriendWizard. The page is shown instead of the conclusion page when 
       the user clicks on the certificate link in a message of type user request.
     - Enabled icons for VOIP plugin
     - Enabled display of plugin version in plugin items
        * Hide the import/export button, and set the new identity CheckBox set checked, when start a new Profile 
          generation from Profile Manager.
        * Set PluginItem icon size to 24
     - Added automatic clean of the friend certificate in ConnectFriendWizard.
     - Fixed code for certificate link generation.
     - Added new Chat style Bubble, generated by Victor for RetroShare
     - Added a profile manager. Shoudl be useful for importing/exporting identities.

  * Bugs
     - fixed nasty bug causing crashes when syncing the keyring from disc
     - added writing of public keyring to a tmp file + rename, to avoid corrupting it when RS stops during the whole operation
     - Added a quick fix for the freeze of RetroShare when using a file dialog on Windows
     - Fixed showup of self signatures in certificates that are not in the keyring already
     - Added code to avoid corruption of bdboot.txt: first write to tmp file then move the file. Refers on 
       Windows utf16ToUtf8 from libretroshare. This forward reference can be improved.
     - Fixed bug with empty certificate strings when clicking on a certificate link with only a PGP id.
     - Removed deadly assert in validate.c:338 causing crashes on error.

retroshare (0.5.3-0.5327~natty) natty; urgency=low

  * Improvements
      - Merged branch v0.5-OpenPGP into trunk. Please read the following important release notes:

          User-level changes:
          ==================
          * libgpgme is not used anymore; it is replaced by a built-in piece of code called OpenPGP-SDK 
            (http://openpgp.nominet.org.uk/cgi-bin/trac.cgi) that was improved to be used by RetroShare
            for handling PGP keys.
          
          * the gnupg keyring is not used anymore. Now, RetroShare has it's own gpg keyring, shared by all instances.
            On linux it's located in ~/.retroshare/pgp/. A lock system prevents multiple locations to read/write keyrings
            simultaneously.
          
          * the trust database from gnupg is not documented, so RetroShare cannot import it. This comes from the fact that
            the GPG standard (RFC4880) asks explicitly not to export trust information. So RetroShare has it's own 
            trust DB shared by locations. This means you need to re-trust people. Sorry for that!
          
          * at start, if no keyring is found, RS will propose to copy the gnupg keyring to use your existing keys. Clicking on 
            "OK" will do the copy, and you should find back all existing locations, except for DSA keys.
          
          * locations for which the suitable keypair is not in the keyring will not be displayed in the login window
          * locations for which the suitable keypair is not a RSA/RSA key will not be displayed. RetroShare does not
            support DSA/Elgamal keypairs yet.
          
          * a key import/export exchange function has been added in the certificate creation window (you go there from the login
            window by clicking on "manage keys/locations". This allows to easily create a new location with the same pgp key on
            another computer. To obtain a suitable keypair using gnupg, you need to concatenate the encrypted private key and the 
            public key into an ascii file. This can be done using:
            		gpg -a --export-secret-keys [your ID] > mykey.asc
          		gpg -a --export [your ID] >> mykey.asc
          
          * importing a key with subkeys in not yet possible. Please remove subkeys before importing.
          
          * The code has been tested for a reasonnable amount of time, but it's not possible to prevent some new bugs 
            to appear. Please report them asap supplying: call-stacks if possible, and terminal output. In particular,
            openpgp has some assert()'s that should not be triggered unless RetroShare is calling it in an improper way.
          
          Internal changes
          ================
          * a specific component, PGPHandler, takes care of the interface between openpgp-sdk and RetroShare
            openpgp-sdk is c-code, with it's own memory management, which has been kept well separated from 
            RetroShare.
          
          * GPG Ids are now a specific class (not a std::string anymore) for code consistency reasons. As strings are
            still used in many places, this requires a few conversions. In particular, AuthGPG takes strings as
            function params and calls GPGHandler with the proper PGPIdType class. In the future, RetroShare should
            only use PGPIdType. The same will be done for SSL ids.
          
          * signature cleaning is still handled by the Retroshare built-in function, not by openpgp, but we will 
            do this later.
          
          Still to do
          ===========
          * DSA needs subkey handling, since the encryption is performed by a Elgamal subkey. Not sure this will be done.
          * GPGIds/SSLIds cleaning (meaning replace strings by appropriate types). Lots of confusion throughout the code 
            in retroshare-gui in particular.
          * key removal from keyring. This is a challenge to keep locations synchronised.

      - Rework of tcponudp/tcpstream should make UDP connections much more stable.
        	* Fixed retransmit algorithm. Much more closely matched to TCP standard: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2988
        	* This increases retransmit timeouts, and reduces the number of packets resent.
        	* Added better debugging for retrans/close as separate #defines.
        	* Further testing is required ;)

      - Added dynamic choose of sources for chunk crc requests. Fixes the bug that would let 
        a transfer not finish if the original surce for a crc is not here anymore.
        If you have a unfinished transfer do a force-check after restart to get back chunks that 
        where still on verification stage.

      - moved channel action menu into right click, for better consistency
      - Enabled word wrap of the description in ChanNewItem.
      - Added a new button in ChanMsgItem and ForumMsgItem to set the message as read (without expanding the message) and 
        remove the item from the news feed.
      - Redesigned ChanMsgItem.
      - updated french translation (Max Romeo)
      - improved build bat file (san)
      - Moved the include folder OpenSSL to the other external includes for Windows compile.
      - added warning for unsupported keys. It is triggered when no valid keypairs are found at start, and when unsupported 
        keys pairs are found when copying the keyring
      - Enabled translation (system default language) of the message box before the login to a profile.
      - Fixed german translation.
      - removed not needed info buttons for the infodialog
      - desactivated TrustMatrix, by the time we decide wether it is worth keeping it, and implement a better version of it
      - updated package building scripts for ubuntu

  * Bugs
      - fixed stupid bug in friendlyUnits() causing crashes when displaying files with size > 1TB
      - possible fix for bug on ARM archs (reported by Ralfk)
      - fixed possible bug due to misplaced mutex (Reported by bNK)
      - added missign break, causing a crash when creating a new key
      - Fixed crash when starting the help browser from friend details the second time.

retroshare (0.5.2-0.4747~natty) natty; urgency=low

  * Improvements
     - Added the real size of all files of a collection to the link when added with drag and drop.
     - ConnectionFriendWizard: Show the messagebox "Your Cert is copied to Clipboard" after copying the cert into the clipboard.
     - Removed "release" from the win32 build in retroshare-nogui.pro.
     - Added retroshare-nogui to the subdir project.

        FT_TM_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT: 10 -> 20 secs (RTT limit of 10 secs is too low -> transfers in long tunnels kept switching between active and inactive)
        INACTIVE_CHUNKS_CHECK_DELAY: 60 -> 240 secs (Chunks are kept longer before beign cancelled, which is now affordable)
        MAX_TIME_INACTIVE_REQUEUED: 60 -> 120 secs.(Transfers a kept longer before being re-prioritized in queue)

  * Bug fixes
     - Added the size of the collection to the link only for files (missing test)
     - Show the correct name in the title of the RsCollectionDialog when the filename contains ".".
     - Fixed creating of the download path of the collection when running as portable version.
