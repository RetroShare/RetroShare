/* ccr . 2015 Aug 01 . Resize Main page and Main window.
 *
 * On very small legacy CRTs of about 15" (38 cm) RetroShare pages are
 * initially too deep (too tall) to fit the screen at 1024x768
 * resolution.  Some can be shrunk down manually from their initial
 * size.  Others cannot.  This patch tries to allow each page to be
 * shrunk somewhat.  Then code that runs elsewhere to fit the logical
 * Main window into the physical screen will have a better chance of
 * success.  Notably, on Linux -- Gnome3 -- X11 systems, only when the
 * Main window first fits entirely into the physical screen, can it
 * then be maximized.
 *
 * This code is borrowed from a Stack Overflow post:
 *
 * o Darkgaze. "Resize QStackedWidget to the Page Which Is Opened." 23
 * Jan. 2013. Online posting. Stack Overflow. 1 Aug. 2015
 * <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14480696/resize-qstackedwidget-to-the-page-which-is-opened>.
