<h3>Advanced: Open Firewall Port</h3>

<p>
You can improve your UnseenP2P performance by opening an External Port.
This will speed up connections and allow more people to connect with you 

The easiest way to do this is by enabling UPnP on your Wireless Box or Router.
As each router is different, you need to find out your Router Model and Google for instructions.

If none of this makes sense, don't worry about it UnseenP2P will still work.
