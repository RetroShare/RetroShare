<ul>
  <li><b>Language</b>:
    UnseenP2P's interface has been translated into many languages by helpful
    volunteers. When UnseenP2P is first run, it will try to guess which language
    your computer is currently using. If UnseenP2P guesses incorrectly, or if
    you prefer a different language, you can choose another language from the
    dropdown box. You will need to restart UnseenP2P after changing the
    displayed language for the changes to take effect.
  </li>
  <li><b>Style</b>:
    In most cases, UnseenP2P will default to using your platform's default
    interface style. If you dislike the default, you can choose whichever
    interface style you prefer from the dropdown box.
  </li>
 <li><b>Style Sheet</b>:
    UnseenP2P will default to using default style sheet.
    If you dislike the default, you can choose whichever
    style sheet you prefer from the dropdown box.
  </li>
</ul>
