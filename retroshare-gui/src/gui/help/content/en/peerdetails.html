<h3>Trust Settings</h3>
    <td><img src="qrc:/images/trustsettings.png"/></td>
<p>
The trust settings refers to the GnuPG web of trust mechanism. <br>
This trust means how you trust your friends when he is signing other PGP keys. <br>
If you set your trust to "full", it means that when your friend signs a key, this key will be shown as validated by the web of trust in the network view.</p>


<a name="signing"/>
<h3>Signing</h3>
<p>

You should sign a key when you are sure that the person who claims ownership on this key is the real owner of the key.  <br>
When you are sure that the name of the key owner is the real name of the emitter of this key, you may sign it to confirm it. <br>
Signing the key will be public unless public discovery is not set. This means your friends can check if you did sign someone's key.</i>
