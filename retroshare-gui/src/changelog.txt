         * patch "AddSearchFilesourceSorted_6951.diff" from Phenom. Adds correct sorting for search results.
         * extended max chunk TTL to 1 hour. A short TTL is not anymore needed since chuns are shared between sources

      - Chat
         * patch "chatdialog_allow_buttons_from_different_plugins_3" from electron. ChatDialog allows 
           now Buttons from different Plugins.

            when no lobby ihas been found yet. Code beautification
         * added lobby ID as tooltip to lobby list

      - Forums
         * added ElidedLabel to be used in places where labels might be too long and therefore

           before jumping to the linked post
         * Added a default background color for the Channel Message Logo for a better look and feel, 
            removed stretching of the logo, set a minimum size, background is now filled black.

      - Notification
         * reworked the notification system, which is now a standalone service. Now plugins can receive notifications.
         * Corrected the layout of the Connect Progress Dialog
         * Changed the logo size for some news feed items to use same size for better look.
         * Added to display blue/black forum message icons for the forum feeds, when forum is anon or signed.
         * Added new feed item types and logic to show connection attempts from forged certificates 
            (e.g. bad signature, bad certificate)
         * Limit number of feed items to 500 to avoid flooding
         * Changed the default stylesheet color for the Security Feed
         * improved display/fixed bugs in security item

      - plugins
         * Added service pointer for forums to the plugin interface
         * FeedReader: Used the forums pointer from the plugin interface instead of the global pointer
         * added missing services in RsPluginInterface class

      - GXS

           Known Identities Widget.
         * Set some minimum header sizes for some items
         * Enabled sorting for the QTreeWidget's
         * fixed temporary to load the Wiki Groups Tree at startup, auto update seems not to work.

      - core
         * moved PGP id and SSLid types into rsid.h, and renamed them with a more appropriate name
         * fixed cipher list for openssl. ECDHE is not configured, so it cannot be used
         * added serialisation methods for SSLId and time_t
         * added an option in the pro file for dsdv, as it is compiled when not used
         * removed status member from FileDetails. Not used => misleading
         * removed asserts in reader_armoured.c, reader_encrypted_se.c, reader_encrypted_seip.c, readerwriter.c
         * Allow loading packets of large size from config files (fixed storing of big messages), 
           and continue on config files skipping items that cannot be deserialised (Modified patch from Phenom)
         * put a hard limit to packet size in pqistore to avoid calling realloc with fancy numbers 
           when the stream has been corrupted

   * Bug fixes
      - fixed bug due to ot sending notifications to the file lists
      - added missign cleanup call in RsAES.cc, causing a small memory leak
      - Changed order of the shutdown to fix a crash of the WebUI plugin. First stop the 
        plugins then the other services.
      - fixed ghost lobby issue (thx to thunder for spotting it out)
      - patch from HM to avoid allocating absurdly long uids
      - added check to only import version 4 keys in the keyring
      - fixed error handling in certificates that could crash RS when a bad cert is pasted
      - fixed proper handling in failed malloc in openpgp-sdk, causing crash with deliberate bad cert.
      - fixed small error in pgphandler, potentially adding empty certs in database
      - limited the number of packets to be parsed in a row, to prevent compressed 
        data to contain an enormous number of packets. Fixes one possible attack pointed out by HM
      - removed potential uninitialized memory read in TlvKey item.
      - fixed mismatched free/delete in p3channels.cc
      - fixed bug introduced in 6965 that prevented people joining private lobbies to see the messages and talk
      - fixed potential attack by supplying non hexadecimal strings as certificate common name
      - Fixed spaces in copy/paste of rich text (Patch from Phenom)

Changes for 0.5.5b

   * Improvements

      - fixed up some debug text (patch from H.Morgan)
      - reduced string for lol bomb filtering, to filter out <\?xml* instead of <\?xml\ *
      - Added freeze option in NetworkView (Modified patch from K. Eisentraut)
      - Updated languages from Transifex
      - fixed up compatibility with Qt5
      - code fixed up for Qt5,added display of Qt version in AboutDialog
      - fixed up compilation for MinGW-w64
      - Added new options to retroshare-gui.pro for Qt 5
      - Added new file QtVersion.h with macros to compile with Qt 4 and Qt 5
      - fixed GUI for encrypted messages. Now showing correct To/From, added icon for decrypted msg, correct To when reply
      - allow change destination directory for queued files (modified patch from Phenom)
      - remove three costly loops in ftController
      - added help strings in some config pages (relays, notify, plugins)
      - added warning label in MakeFriendWizard to warn against too many friends
      - changed the voip icons, disable the voip buttons when friend is offline.
      - added scope timer to measure times conveniently

     PGP
      - added restriction to only accept self-signed certificates for friend keys
      - added test program for identity import
      - removed asserts from validate.c, and signature.c in openpgp-sdk
        it will not be shared until re-hashed. Should prevent chunks error in files that get hashed while being copied.
      - do not accept keys without a uid. Previously this was crashing RS
      - added check over recursive compression depth. Fixes CVE-2013-4402

     Channels:
      - Added back the Subscribe Button to Channels
      - Use destination directory when manually downloading a file from a channel
      - Show destination directory in channel details
      - Fixed utf8 issue when choosing the destination directory

     GUI
      - show fingerprint in ConfCertDialog, and splitted the string with spaces. Removed 
        the use of the ambiguous peer id for both pgp and locations ids

     Global router (Not active yet. Is a replacement to tunnels for messaging. Wil allow offline anonymous distant messages)
      - squeleton code for the whole system
      - computation/update of routing probabilities

     File Transfer (Speed changes according to experiments from jolavilette. Brings the max LAN speed from 1.3MB/s to approx 13MB/s)
      - set desiredRate of peers to 10MB/s instead of 1MB/s
      - maximum number of active chunks per peer is now 20 (that was a serious limiting factor)
      - ticks that bring no data are not accounted for in the speed estimate anymore. The data is averaged over all ticks 
        since the previous non zero data chunk -> this brings much more stability to sources and removes lots of oscillation.
      - added post-hash check for file modification. If the file has been modified while being hashed, 
      - removed false warning that come up when openning a non existing file in ftFileCreator.

     Shared Files
      - changed re-hashign strategy. Now uses in priority the system time of the index file as a reference for new files. This automatically
        accounts for changes in system time and fixes the re-hashing bug for daylight changing time. In case the reference time cannot be
        establishd, the comparison reverts to the old method. This change is backward compatible and should not cause a re-hash.

  * Improvements
     Optimisations/compilation:
      - re-wrote cleanupDirectory() function. As this a cause of the slow startup.  Startup time is massively improved!
      - Fixed compile of the libraries with MinGW 4.8 on Windows.
      - Removed the external library pthreads 2.8.0 on Windows build and used the library of MinGW (version 2.8.0 too). 
        This fixes header mixup of bo th versions.
      - Switched to the release version of pthread so the name of the dll changes from pthreadGC2d.dll to pthreadGC2.dll. 
        The new dll can be found in the bin directory of MinGW.
      - Optimized p3HistoryMgr::cleanOldMessages

     File Transfer:
      - restore file state when restart (Modified patch from Phenom)
      - Enabled multi-tunneling by consistently perturbating partial tunnel id in TRs.
        This causes tunnels with a different route to have different ids and therefore
        coexist as different sources for a given transfer.
        This should cause file transfers to have more tunnels and therefore a better balance
        of bandwidth over intermediate peers. This needs to be evaluated on a large scale network.
      - included random bias in tunnel ID computation to make them impossible to correlate to the end points

     Distant chat/lobbies/chat:
      - added the possibility to distant chat with unverified identities, while warning the user about it. Should help distant chatting.
      - removed warning that happens when lobby has no activity

     Key creation
      - added entropy collection system based on mouse movement to location/identity creation, to make keys less predictable

     Connectivity:
      - Made connection progress dialog only show up when really making friend

     Security:
      - Enabled PFS for SSH connections, based on a 4096 bits safe prime. This is retro-compatible, meaning that 
        old peers will connect to the new one using PFS if they act as a client (meaning they request the connection)
      - added limit to posts on chat lobbies to 6000 characters, removing the risk of enormous posts crafted to kill the msg history
      - added filter to take care of svg bombs that can be hidden in the strings in lobbies,forums,channels and chat
      - added control for suspicious message activity in chat lobbies. Lobby items are not bounced if coming 
        from a peer that sends more messages per seconds than a given limit. The limit is adaptive and depends on lobby count
      - added limit in number of chat lobby ids sent by a peer
      - added filter to remove xml bombs in all std::wstrings. 

     Various gui stuff:
      - added a "Load Images" system to messages.
      - added new delegate for BW statistics window. Changed column names to more appropriate values (Patch from Phenom)
      - Added proper sorting of DL files according to sources (Patch from Phenom)
      - changed the connect wizard so that we can add someone key to keyring without making friend. 
      - fixed image resizing for channel thumbnails. Apparently there is a bug in Qt preventing 
        Qt::KeepAspectRatioByExpanding to work correctly
      - Changed the additional buttons of ChatLobbyDialog and AudioPopupChatDialog to QToolButton.
      - added some sound files
      - changed the voip icons and the tooltips
      - added fingerprint to cryptopage
      - added tree items for chat lobbies. 
      - moved help browser from MainPage to new base class FloatingHelpBrowser
      - added warning info label to MakeFriendWizard
      - Added info widget for encrypted messages in MessageWidget
      - removed copy/paste of links of type PERSON in friendlist. This caused confusion and did not provide 
        anything useful since the creation of the full certificate links
      - changed default header text and context menu icons
      - changed the default style layout of profile creation dialog
      - highlight peers in network graph according to friendship distance from selected node

     Chat lobbies
      - added history parameters for chat lobbies
      - added max storage time for items in chat history. Avoids filling up the history with chat from volatile peers.
      - worked out the layout in config->ChatPage in a more compact design and added help

  * Bug fixes
      - fixed import of retroshare identities that have multiple signatures from the same key ID. Fixed bug reported by claude37
      - split lastRecvTimeStamp into two different time stamps: one for last
        time the file is wrote (or data is received) and one for last activity
        that is used (and sometimes reset) by ftcontroller when queuing files
      - fixed display of correct IP for connected friends. Only the external IP was shown previously. Port is not 
        shown because it is random and could be misleading. 
      - filter out disallowed direct sources from file request source list. Should systematically prevent unwanted direct transfers
      - removed potential deadlock in notifyQt
      - fixed bug that would cause virtual peers list for outgoing files to never get cleanred up. Also improved 
        cost of updating the status of virtual peers. Many thanks to Jolavillette for finding this out!  
      - fixed missing update of transferred bytes count, that caused tunnels to not show a correct speed estimate on server side
      - fixed bug in turtle router, causing potential memory access error in rare occasions (sendItem does not 
        delete items fast enough, normally).
      - added missing setPeerState that caused tunnels to get stuck to default minimum rate unless 
        the list of connected peers change
      - fixed bug showing play for unfinished files and preview for finished ones

      - removed #ifdef USE_NEW_CHUNK_CHECKING_CODE (enabled by default). Disable assume_availablility to put chunks or

      - Added little upnp utility / test.
      - added checksum for new certificate format. Will be enabled in 0.6.

Changes for 0.5.4d

  * Improvements
      - DHT
         * disable bitdht printStatus
         * increased expected dht startup period, as message rate has been dropped.
         * updated bdboot.txt file.

      - Chat
         * Made the private lobbies more accessible:
            - record which friend participates in a lobby even after they unsubscribed. The lobby 
              list that is sent to these 
            - friends contains the privaye lobby as well. In practice, people jsut need to be invited 
              once to a private lobby. 
            - Afterwards, they get the lobby in the list of nearby lobbies and can join by clicking on it.
            - added new item RsChatLobbyList_deprecated2, to replace old existing item. Should be removed in v0.6
            - changed PublicLobbies for VisibleLobbies in the code, to avoid confusion
            - the change is backward compatible, although old peers won't receive private lobby info from 
              new peers, of course.

      - GUI
         * Set email address in GenCertDialog to optional.

            - made OperatingMode temporary - not saved.
            - Moved DataRate interface from rsiface (old) -> rsConfig.
            - Internally moved storage of data rate from pqipersongroup -> p3serverconfig
            - made DataRate + Operating Mode work together.
            - add ToolTip to OpModeStatus .... (can't actually view - please correct as necessary)

         * Fixed utf8 characters for group names in RemoteDirModel (shared files).
         * Fixed layout of the FriendRequestPage in ConnectFriendWizard.
         * Added flags for services and service permissions for peers
           Flags are identity-related, meaning that all locations of the same peers have the same flags.
            - It's now possible to tweak which services each peer can use. Service that can be disabled are
              forums/channels, discovery, anonymous routing.
            - by default, peers have all flags on.
      - File Transfer
         * use a std::map to search file hashes instead of sweeping the entire database. Improves performance a lot.

      - OpenPGP-SDK
         * Added function "ops_open" to openpgpsdk to open files with utf8 characters on Windows.
         * changed fopen into RsDirUtil::rs_fopen in PGPHandler, to allow paths with utf8 chars on windows. 
           Shoudl probably fix many startup issues

  * Bugs
      - added proper filtering of directories from RSLinks and RsCollection to avoid the possibility of writing out of the 
        download directory.
      - Added missing closeConnection when the connection dies with SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL.
      - Fixed display of files in flat view. The files of friends are shown again
      - fixed bug in ShareManager causing directory flags to be set on wrong directory after sorting
      - Protected waitingIds with Mutex in pqipersongrp.cc.
      - Reviewed Mutex in pqihandler.
         * In general it is okay, except for: DataRate Handling, and Win32 specific: WaitingList.
         * Cleaned up some functions.
         * renamed createPerson and createListener to locked_createPerson and locked_createListener.
        This is required as neither Listener nor Person are thread safe (TODO).
      - fixed missing error msg in p3cfgmgr when serialisation fails.
      

Changes for 0.5.4c

  * Improvements

        * fixed bug preventing share manager to modify more than one directory at once
        * Moved most of the hardcoded colors of lists and trees to the file default.qss (with help from braindead).

          at the top when the end of the list is reached.
        * Changed SoundManger to allow the plugins to play sounds.
        * Added example to VOIP (commented out).
        * Added more PRE_TARGETDEPS for Windows compile.
		* Added Search Filter for the FriendsList
        * set a minimum spacing on ChatWidget
        * Added to display tooltip's for the Voip button's

		- removed some warnings and debug info 
		- Fixed sensitivity of the action in the context menu to copy a link from the chat text 
			when scrollbars are visible.
		- Stored some license files to utf-8 encoding, required by nsis installer
		- Changed font color in ProfileWidget to standard.

		- Add direct public sources for files shared in channels, when available
		- Improvements to turtle router:
			* made faster tunnels stay longer by increasing tunnel campain time. Should favor fast tunnels. 
			* desactivated tunnel shortenning since it cannot produce consistent tunnels every time
			* increase cache TTL for search requests to 240 secs and tunnel requests to 120 secs.
          This should remove some zombie tunnels and search requests.
		- Debian Buildscript. Fixed Version for Packagename
    
    - VOIP plugin
        * Added support for external translation files for the main application and the plugins LinksCloud and VOIP.
          The following files are loaded from the directory <executable dir>/translations: retroshare_*.qm, LinksCloud_*.qm, VOIP_*.qm
        * Added turkish voip translation
        * Added Brazilian Portuguese VOIP translation
        * Added support for external translation files for the main application and the plugins LinksCloud and VOIP.

        * Added turkish voip translation
        * Added Brazilian Portuguese VOIP translation    

    - FT
        * added dynamic adding of direct sources from file lists. Useful for channels. Is called once every 61 seconds.
        * Added new link type: EXTRA_FILE, to allow sendign links with sources included so as to trigger direct transfer.
          This makes possible to send files through chat without permitting tunnel access to the files. The client requests
          the file as a direct transfer only, using the supplied source.

     - Patch to allow compilation on BSD
     - Fixed command to grab upnp patched version

     - Merged branch that provide group-based file permissions.
          Now users can sort peers into groups in the friend list, and attribute flags and parent groups 
          to the directories in the share manager.
          
        Flags are B-B-N, meaning in order:
           - browsable for peers in the parent groups
           - browsable for everyone
           - network wide for everyone
           Backward compatibility makes previously BN flags been interpreted as -BN, meaning 
           browsable/network wide for everyone.

        The merge also includes a significant improvement of the naming of flags with incompatible types
        which should sort out some existing bugs as well, since inconsistencies in flag usage have been
        found during the process.
        
    - DHT
        * Improved the dht msg history storage.
        * specify how long we store for.
        * cleanup old msgs.
        * improve printing of history.
        * add timeline storage as well.
        * disabled by default, enable USE_HISTORY in bdnode.c

         There appears to be a bug related to copying bdId's around.
         Some of the bootstrap ids are malformed, and this crashes rs.        

  * Bugs
     - suppressed bug due to not cleaning source lists. Would cause transfers to have inconsistent direct sources
     - added additional checking of incoming compressed chunk map, in case the data is 
       currupted, which might happens with a corrupted ft_transfer.cfg file.
     - fixed permission of drap+dropped files. all attached files get added to extra list, 
       but with different permission flags depending on the client. From that, we compute 
       sharing permissions : turtle, or direct transfer only 
     - suppressed unitialized memory read in p3peers.cc
     - added missing mutex in destructor of ftFileProvider. Probably responsible for some random crashes
     - Fixed stupid bug inDHT. Labels are the wrong way around.
        This meant limit is set to HIGH (50msg/sec) when it should be LOW 
        (5msg/sec)
     - Fixed "jumping" of the items in channels and news feed when items are changed (load, toggle and remove).
     - Added workaround for QTBUG-3372.
     - Hide request Label, when peer is unknown
     - Fixed edit of a message with plaintext. The newlines remain unchanged (investigated by braindead)

		- Enable Translations for Voip plugin
		- Fixed some spelling errors
		- Changed font color in ProfileWidget to standard.
		- Fixed german language.

		- add direct public sources for files shared in channels, when available
		- patch, to make the bandwidth graph refresh rate smoother

	* Improvements to turtle router:
		- made faster tunnels stay longer by increasing tunnel campain time. Should favor fast tunnels. 
		- desactivated tunnel shortenning since it cannot produce consistent tunnels every time
		- increase cache TTL for search requests to 240 secs and tunnel requests to 120 secs.
			Will remove some zombie tunnels and search requests.

     - Moved some internal stylesheets to the file Standard.qss.
     - Tweaked standard style of the feed items.
     - moved file rsversion.h to rsguiversion.h, since it caused a conflict with libretroshare/src/util/rsversion.h 
       when included as util/rsversion.h. Updated version detail script.
     - reworked context channel menu to allow unsubscribing from own channels. Removed some irrelevant items.

        * Removed some unnecessary style sheets.
        * Added two internal stylesheets:
           - default.qss - This file is used as default for all stylesheets (e.g. the frames of 
             the AvatarWidget) and can be overloaded from the selected stylesheet
           - Standard.qss - The standard stylesheet for the current look of RetroShare. More internal stylesheets can be added.
             The plan is to move nearly all internal stylesheets to the files Standard.qss/default.qss. 
             After that the "empty" stylesheet should represent the system theme of the os.

          User-level changes:
          ==================
          * libgpgme is not used anymore; it is replaced by a built-in piece of code called OpenPGP-SDK 
            (http://openpgp.nominet.org.uk/cgi-bin/trac.cgi) that was improved to be used by RetroShare
            for handling PGP keys.
          
          * the gnupg keyring is not used anymore. Now, RetroShare has it's own gpg keyring, shared by all instances.
            On linux it's located in ~/.retroshare/pgp/. A lock system prevents multiple locations to read/write keyrings
            simultaneously.
          
          * the trust database from gnupg is not documented, so RetroShare cannot import it. This comes from the fact that
            the GPG standard (RFC4880) asks explicitly not to export trust information. So RetroShare has it's own 
            trust DB shared by locations. This means you need to re-trust people. Sorry for that!
          
          * at start, if no keyring is found, RS will propose to copy the gnupg keyring to use your existing keys. Clicking on 
            "OK" will do the copy, and you should find back all existing locations, except for DSA keys.
          
          * locations for which the suitable keypair is not in the keyring will not be displayed in the login window
          * locations for which the suitable keypair is not a RSA/RSA key will not be displayed. RetroShare does not
            support DSA/Elgamal keypairs yet.
          
          * a key import/export exchange function has been added in the certificate creation window (you go there from the login
            window by clicking on "manage keys/locations". This allows to easily create a new location with the same pgp key on
            another computer. To obtain a suitable keypair using gnupg, you need to concatenate the encrypted private key and the 
            public key into an ascii file. This can be done using:
            		gpg -a --export-secret-keys [your ID] > mykey.asc
          		gpg -a --export [your ID] >> mykey.asc
          
          * importing a key with subkeys in not yet possible. Please remove subkeys before importing.
          
          * The code has been tested for a reasonnable amount of time, but it's not possible to prevent some new bugs 
            to appear. Please report them asap supplying: call-stacks if possible, and terminal output. In particular,
            openpgp has some assert()'s that should not be triggered unless RetroShare is calling it in an improper way.
          
          Internal changes
          ================
          * a specific component, PGPHandler, takes care of the interface between openpgp-sdk and RetroShare
            openpgp-sdk is c-code, with it's own memory management, which has been kept well separated from 
            RetroShare.
          
          * GPG Ids are now a specific class (not a std::string anymore) for code consistency reasons. As strings are
            still used in many places, this requires a few conversions. In particular, AuthGPG takes strings as
            function params and calls GPGHandler with the proper PGPIdType class. In the future, RetroShare should
            only use PGPIdType. The same will be done for SSL ids.
          
          * signature cleaning is still handled by the Retroshare built-in function, not by openpgp, but we will 
            do this later.
          
          Still to do
          ===========
          * DSA needs subkey handling, since the encryption is performed by a Elgamal subkey. Not sure this will be done.
          * GPGIds/SSLIds cleaning (meaning replace strings by appropriate types). Lots of confusion throughout the code 
            in retroshare-gui in particular.
          * key removal from keyring. This is a challenge to keep locations synchronised.

      - Rework of tcponudp/tcpstream should make UDP connections much more stable.
        	* Fixed retransmit algorithm. Much more closely matched to TCP standard: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2988
        	* This increases retransmit timeouts, and reduces the number of packets resent.
        	* Added better debugging for retrans/close as separate #defines.
        	* Further testing is required ;)

      - Added dynamic choose of sources for chunk crc requests. Fixes the bug that would let 
        a transfer not finish if the original surce for a crc is not here anymore.
        If you have a unfinished transfer do a force-check after restart to get back chunks that 
        where still on verification stage.

      - moved channel action menu into right click, for better consistency
      - Enabled word wrap of the description in ChanNewItem.
      - Added a new button in ChanMsgItem and ForumMsgItem to set the message as read (without expanding the message) and 
        remove the item from the news feed.
      - Redesigned ChanMsgItem.
      - updated french translation (Max Romeo)
      - improved build bat file (san)
      - Moved the include folder OpenSSL to the other external includes for Windows compile.
      - added warning for unsupported keys. It is triggered when no valid keypairs are found at start, and when unsupported 
        keys pairs are found when copying the keyring
      - Enabled translation (system default language) of the message box before the login to a profile.
      - Fixed german translation.
      - removed not needed info buttons for the infodialog
      - desactivated TrustMatrix, by the time we decide wether it is worth keeping it, and implement a better version of it
      - updated package building scripts for ubuntu

     - Added windows for bandwidth/display analysis in tray menu
     - Reworked tcponudp/tcpstream. Should make UDP connections much more stable
       Increses increases retransmit timeouts, and reduces the number of packets resent.
       Added better debugging for retrans/close as separate #defines.
     - Moved QoS from pqihandler to pqistreamer. Removes one out queue, suppressed lags
       when program is eavily loaded.
     - Added bandwidth monitoring service to libretroshare
         * p3bwctrl.h/.cc & rsbwctrlitems.h/.cc
         * New Interface in pqihandler to extract the data.
         * New Interface in rsconfig to display in GUI.
         * Added extra debugging in pqistreamer for catching big outqueues.
     - Enabled full chunk checking code:
         * unchecked chunks are not made available to swarming sources, not saved as done.
         * force check now uses the simple method to put all chunks in checking mode
         * force checked files can be cancelled (finally!)
         * improved display (use red for active chunks, yellow for checking)
         * cache file are not using chunk checking (assume_availability=true)
     - fixed compilation on OSX
     - Added patch #3510849 from Adam (interfect). Capitalize "copy RetroShare key to clipboard"

     - Fixed message in pgphandler when signing a post
     - Fixed small display issue causing the availability map to become black when more than 6 sources are present
     - Added missing close of the temporary keyring file. Now the keyring is saved properly and the newly 
       added keys are not lost after shutdown of RetroShare.
     - Patch from AsamK to avoid crash when no uids are present in the key. How can this happen anyway?
     - fixed nasty bug causing crashes when syncing the keyring from disc

     - Fixed showup of self signatures in certificates that are not in the keyring already
     - Added code to avoid corruption of bdboot.txt: first write to tmp file then move the file. Refers on 
       Windows utf16ToUtf8 from libretroshare. This forward reference can be improved.

        MAX_TIME_INACTIVE_REQUEUED: 60 -> 120 secs.(Transfers a kept longer before being re-prioritized in queue)

    - DHT:
        * Reduced Default DHT Message rate from 50msg/sec to 5msg/sec
           (Searches now take longer, but it should make crappy firewalls happy.)

        * Changed the name and the description of the plugin to utf8.
        * fixed download priority handling. Proof-tested on multiple DL from the same peer.

     - libretroshare Improvements:
        * corrected disabled RequestdirDetails in FileIndexStore to be able to retrieve root directory of a user ID

       also missing own-msgs bug caused by not accounting for msgs created by users
     - Added a name to the RsMutex class, allowing debugging of the waiting time for a lock of RsMutex in 
       rsthreads.h with #define RSMUTEX_DEBUG 300. That means all locks waiting longer than 300ms are logged into the stderr.

      - TcoOnUdp code:
         * Reduce Maximum Transmission size from 1500 -> 1000. This is the cause of Failed Connections. 
           It looks like UDP packets are being truncated from 1520 -> 1492 bytes, and this is killing the

Changes for v0.5.1a

New features (DHT, Channels, Network View) 
Improved stability w.r.t. previous version 0.5.0g"
Added lots of improvements, check for details svn log entrys

Changes for v0.5.0g

* corrected a bug that caused file copy error: a closeFile() was missing when the file is complete. 


Changes for v0.5.0f

* restored the retroshare-nogui executable
* bug corrections in cachestrapper
* bug corrections in RsTunnelItem and p3tunnel
* better error handling in rstunnelitem on windows
* removed deadlock in data multiplex
* improved p3disc info update


Changes for v0.5.0e

* Made a pass on the code in p3disc. 

* Corrected some bugs:
    - suppressed an unwanted return in packet treatment
    - prevented sending info to a peer about itself
    - changed askInfoToAllPeers() such as not to discard info from peers with
      NODISC flag (because we especially need info for these)
    - enabled receiving p3disc info even if p3discovery is disabled. Indeed,
      disabeling p3disc is a measure of protection, so it should limit the 
      export of p3disc info, not the import.
    - removed test discarding info about dummy friends, because it is useless
    - don't discard info about peers that have the NODISC flag (meaning that we
      especially need info for them)
    - added safety check about received GPG keys. Before we relied on this test
      being performed by p3ConnMgr::addFriend()
    - added some debug info

* put correct (i.e. non conservative) size for RsDiscReply packets

* corrected bug in rsdiscitem that prevented RsDiscReply packets to transfer cp serialiser/rsdiscitems.cc

* automatic removal of file lists from deleted peers, at restart (After double check that this does not alter exchange of file lists in any way)

* set heartbeat values to intermediate value

* added verification for file size computation (bug correction)

* augmented the heartbeat parameters, to reduce the stress on connections. Seems to help a lot when the traffic is high.

Changes for v0.5.0d

Package improvements:

* suppressed package dependency on gpg-agent

Improvements:

* implemented a free disk space checking method, with a warning when running low
* fixed proper sorting/updating of IP lists.
* only keep the most recent port for identical ips.
* don't start when the local address+port are already in use to avoid corrupting file lists, config files etc
* added failure tests for fwrite
* added tests against wrong ip 1.0.0.0 on MacOS

Minor bug corrections:

* added a check to avoid (possibly rare) data races in data multiplex
* suppressed double click action for download in Shared File lists


Changes for v0.5.0c

* Fixes two problems in the current group chat:
  - the parser fails to embed two links in the same sentence
  - the parser can potentially put smileys in the middle of <a> tags
  Solution:
  Since the message is in HTML, it is parsed into a DOM tree, then that DOM tree
  is traversed and only the text nodes are parsed (see HandleRichText.cpp for details).
  Bonus fixes:
  - missing std:: for endl (which was falling back to its Qt counterpart)
  - commenting useless code in PeersDialog::smileyWidgetgroupchat()
  - replacing int by size_t
  - RetroShare.pro now queries gpgme-config for its include path
* fixed Memory leaks:
	- getLocalInterfaces -> iptable = (MIB_IPADDRTABLE *) malloc(dwSize);
	- main -> RshareSettings  *_settings = new RshareSettings();
	- ExtAddrFinder::~ExtAddrFinder - use free for pointer allocated with malloc
*	fixed RetroShare stopped responding during signing a key and asking for password.
	- The QSingleShotTimer of ConfCertDialog wants to update the gui and stopped in  PeerItem::updateItem.
* fixed chat bug that was truncating some messages, due to using a uint16_t to store a local size. Totally backward compatible.
* fixed	crash with second open of HelpDialog solved
* implemented a short circuit to local cache transfers. 
  - This saves a large number of file descriptors, and improves reactivity of the software

Changes for v0.5.0b

* suppressed unused files 
* added a checkpoint to file hashing, to save intermediate results every 10 GB
* corrected memory leak in p3disc heart-beat system.
* correct bug with selection with human readable delegate.
