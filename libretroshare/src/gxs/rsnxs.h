 * Retroshare General Network Exchange Service: \n
 * Interface:
 *   - This provides a module to service peer's requests for GXS messages \n
 *      and also request GXS messages from other peers. \n
 *   - The general mode of operation is to sychronise all messages/grps between
 *     peers
 *
 * The interface is sparse as this service is mostly making the requests to other GXS components
 *
 * Groups:
 *   - As this is where exchanges occur between peers, this is also where group's relationships
 *     should get resolved as far as
 *   - Per implemented GXS there are a set of rules which will determine whether data is transferred
 *     between any set of groups
 *
 *  1 allow transfers to any group
 *  2 transfers only between group
 *   - the also group matrix settings which is by default everyone can transfer to each other
