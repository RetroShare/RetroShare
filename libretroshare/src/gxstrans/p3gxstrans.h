 * unless the user ask for them being sent in clear text ( this is not supposed
 * to happen in non testing environment so warnings and stack traces are printed
 * in the log if an attempt to send something in clear text is made ).
 * p3GxsTrans try to hide metadata so the travelling message signed by the author
 * but the recipient is not disclosed, instead to avoid everyone trying to
 * decrypt every message a hint has been introduced, the hint is calculated in a
 * way that one can easily prove that a message is not destined to someone, but
 * cannot prove the message is destined to someone
 * @see RsGxsTransMailItem::recipientHint for more details.
 * p3GxsTrans expose a simple API to send and receive mails, the API also
 * provide notification for the sending mail status @see sendMail(...),
 * @see querySendStatus(...), @see registerGxsTransClient(...),
 * @see GxsTransClient::receiveGxsTransMail(...),
