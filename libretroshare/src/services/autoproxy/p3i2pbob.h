/*
 * This class implements I2P BOB (BASIC OPEN BRIDGE) communication to allow RS
 * to automatically remote control I2P to setup the needed tunnel.
 * BOB is a simple text-based interface: https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/bob
 *
 * Note 1:
 *	One tunnel is enough even for hidden locations since it can be used
 *	bidirectional. (In contrast to what RS I2P users had to set up manually.)
 *
 * Note 2:
 *	BOB tunnels are no SOCKS tunnel. Therefore pqissli2pbob implements a simplified
 *	proxy specially for BOB tunnels.
 *
 * Note 3:
 *	BOB needs a unique name as an ID for each tunnel.
 *	We use 'RetroShare-' + 8 base32 characters.
 *
 * Design:
 *	The service uses three state machines to manage its task:
 *		int stateMachineBOB();
 *			mBOBState
 *		int stateMachineController();
 *			mState
 *			mTask
 *
 * stateMachineBOB:
 *	This state machine manages the low level communication with BOB. It basically has a linked
 *	list (currently a implemented as a std::map) that contains a command and the next
 *	state.
 *	Each high level operation (start up / shut down / get keys) is represented by a
 *	chain of states. E.g. the chain to retrieve new keys:
 *		mCommands[bobState::setnickN] = {setnick, bobState::newkeysN};
 *		mCommands[bobState::newkeysN] = {newkeys, bobState::getkeys};
 *		mCommands[bobState::getkeys]  = {getkeys, bobState::clear};
 *		mCommands[bobState::clear]    = {clear,   bobState::quit};
 *		mCommands[bobState::quit]     = {quit,    bobState::cleared};
 *
 * stateMachineController:
 *	This state machone manages the high level tasks.
 *	It is controlled by mState and mTask.
 *
 *		mTast:
 *			Tracks the high level operation (like start up).
 *			It will keep its value even when a task is done to track
 *			the requested BOB state.
 *			When other operations are performed like a conection check
 *			the last task gets backed up and is later restored again
 *
 *		mState:
 *			This state lives only for one operation an manages the communication
 *			with the BOB instance. This is basically connecting, starting BOB
 *			protocol and disconnecting
 *
 * How a task looks like:
 *	1) RS sets task using the ticket system
 *	2) stateMachineController connects to BOBs control port, sets mBobState to a lists head
 *	3) stateMachineBOB processes command chain
 *	4) stateMachineBOB is done and sets mBobState to cleared signaling that the connection
 *		is cleared and can be closed
 *	5) stateMachineController disconnects from BOBs control port and updates mState
